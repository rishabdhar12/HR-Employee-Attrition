## What is Attrition?

Attrition, in Human Resource terminology, refers to the phenomenon of the employees leaving the company. Attrition in a company is usually measured with a metric called attrition rate, which simply measures the no of employees moving out of the company (voluntary resigning or laid off by the company). Attrition Rate is also referred as churn rate or turnover.

Importance of Attrition

High attrition is a cause of concern for a company as it presents a cost to the company. The company loses on the amount it spent to recruit and select these employees and to train them for their respective jobs. The company may also have to spend additional money to fill the vacancies left open by these employees. Hence it becomes critical for a company to keep a tab on the attrition rate which down-sizes the employee base.


## Types of Attrition

Broadly, there are two types of attrition which occur in any company.

1. Voluntary- When an employee leaves the company for a better job opportunity or career growth or more pay, and leaves on his own.

2. Involuntary- If an employee is terminated from a job due to some ethical issue or lack or performance. Sometimes, a degrowing business also forces employees to quit the job, which leads to a higher rate of people leaving.

3. Retirement- Once an employee finishes his/her tenure at a company and retires. This is mostly a natural attrition that occurs and companies are prepared with succession planning.


Knowing the most likely reasons why employees leave the organization, can help the organization take action and reduce the level of Attrition inside the organization.

I have constructed a very simple pipeline of predicting employee attrition, from some basic Exploratory Data Analysis to feature engineering as well as implementing three learning models in the form of a K-Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest and a Gradient Boosting classifier. This whole notebook takes less than a minute to run and it even returns a 87% accuracy in its predictions.
